# K-means
Unsupervised Learning (K-means)

The main aim of this project is to implement unsupervised learning using K-means algorithm on the given dataset of 2-D points with 2 different strategies of initializing centroids. With the two strategies these data points have to be clustered into k clusters with k ranging from 2 to 10. After the clustering is done objective function has to be calculated for each data point with the corresponding centroid for all the k. The resultant objective function values have to be plotted with the number of clusters k for both the strategies to summarize the results.
