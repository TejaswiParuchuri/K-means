# K-means
Unsupervised Learning (K-means)

The main aim of this project is to implement unsupervised learning using K-means algorithm on the given dataset of 2-D points with 2 different strategies of initializing centroids. With the two strategies these data points have to be clustered into k clusters with k ranging from 2 to 10. After the clustering is done objective function has to be calculated for each data point with the corresponding centroid for all the k. The resultant objective function values have to be plotted with the number of clusters k for both the strategies to summarize the results. 

Dataset:

The given dataset contains 300 2-D data points which means the data will be an array of size 300 X 2 which will kind of represent the co-ordinates of the data points by giving the x and y co-ordinates of the data points. 
 
The program is implemented using python 3.5 programming language. The program takes the parameter value as below while execution based on the requirement to plot scatter graphs or not. Plots of objective function will be plotted irrespective of parameter value input, but the scatter plot graphs will not be plotted if the parameter value of plot_scatters is not given as ‘yes’. Default value of plot_scatters is No which means scatter plot graphs will not be plotted by default.
